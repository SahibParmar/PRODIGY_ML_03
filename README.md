# Dog vs Cat Image Classification using SVM and ResNet18

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project that classifies images of dogs and cats. The project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on features extracted from images using the ResNet18 model, a popular deep learning model for image classification.

The dataset used for this project is the [Dogs vs Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) from Kaggle. The dataset includes 25,000 images of dogs and cats for training the model.

The full code for the project is contained in the Jupyter notebook `prodigy_ml_03.ipynb`. This notebook includes all the steps involved in the project, from loading and preprocessing the data, to training the SVM classifier, and evaluating its performance.

The file `Predictions_on_test_set.csv` contains the model's predictions on a test set that was provided along with the training data in the dataset link. These predictions can be used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
